For the GSLC 1 Assignment OOP, I have created a simple Maze Solver program. When the program is run, it will automatically generate a maze with the size 10 x 10. After that, it will show the shortest path from the start (number 2) until the end (number 3) if it's possible or it could show there is no path found for the answer. The number 1 in the maze is the obstacle, therefore the algorithm has to avoid number 1.
